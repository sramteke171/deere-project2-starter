* ‚ùó A git repository not inside the class repo.

* implement at least 10 User Stories
* Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process
* Be deployed online and accessible to the public via Heroku
* Have a link to your hosted working app in the README.md file in your github repo

* A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach was taken, unsolved problems, user stories, and notes to yourself so you can come back to your project later in the course and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc.

## MVP - Stretch Goal:

- more than 2 models
- Authentication - encrypt-decrypt passwords

#Nice to have - Recommended Features
